# Automatidata

### Description

Project working working with the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) to build a model that 
predicts taxi fares ahead of rides for an app they were building and to build a model that predicts whether or not customers would leave a tip to generate more revenue for taxi drivers.

### Problem Statement

How can we predict taxi fares and whether a customer will leave a tip ahead of rides?

### Task

Build, evaluate, and choose a predictive model that predicts taxi fares ahead of rides and another model that predicts whether a customer will leave a tip.

### Analysis Plan

1. Import necessary libraries/modules
2. Perform initial EDA
3. Conduct data cleaning
   - Nulls
   - Duplicates
   - Outliers
4. Perform full EDA
   - Data wrangling and feature engineering
5. Conduct A/B test to determine whether there is a relationship between payment type and fare amount
6. Build/evaluate Multiple Linear Regression model to predict taxi fares ahead of rides
7. Build/evaluate/choose between Random Forest and XGBoost models to predict whether a customer will leave a tip
8. Provide final recommendations/next steps
